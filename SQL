-Case Study: The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the US domestic energy network. Recently, the AEMR management team has been
noticing large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017. We will explore and clean the data to examine two main areas of concer: 1. 
energy stability and Market Outages and 2. energy losses and market reliability. 

-I will start by examining most common outage types, duartion and frequency to compare frequency and duration of each outage types. Then, we can dive further to see
which energy provider have more outages than their peers while focusing on forced outages. 

- Examing numbers of valid (when status is 'Approved') outage events in 2016 / 2017. 
SELECT Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Status, Reason
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status="Approved"
	AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2016
GROUP BY Status, Reason
ORDER BY Reason

SELECT Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Status, Reason
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
	AND YEAR(Start_Time)=2017
GROUP BY Status, Reason
ORDER BY Reason

- Average duration in days for each approved outage types to find most common outage types
SELECT Status, Reason, Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
    ROUND(AVG(ROUND((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24,2)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time)
ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), Reason

- Monthly count of all approved outage types
SELECT Status, Reason, Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Month(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
	AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2016
GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month

SELECT Status, Reason, Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Month(Start_Time) as Month
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
	AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2017
GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Reason, Month

- Total number of all approved outage types that occured per month to find how frequently outages occur
SELECT Status, Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Month(Start_Time) as Month, Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status, Month(Start_Time), Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Month(Start_Time)

- Count of all approved outage types for all participant codes for 2016 and 2017
SELECT Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Participant_Code

- Avg duration of all approved outage types for participant codes to find if there are any energy providers that have more outages than their peers which may indicate
that these providers are unreliable
SELECT Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time) as Year, 
    ROUND(AVG(ROUND((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24,2)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), CAST(Avg(CAST(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY,Start_Time,End_Time)AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) DESC

- Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what percent were Forced Outage
SELECT Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, Reason, Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Reason='Forced'
	AND Status = 'Approved'
GROUP BY Reason, Year(Start_Time)



-In a situation where the outages are forced, the energy provider may not be able to provide energy and is forced offline. If many energy providers are forced offline
at the same time, it could lead to energy security risk taht AEMR needs to mitigate. To ensure this doesn't occur, the AEMR is intered in exploring percent of forced
outages in 2016 and 2017, average duration of a forced outage, any increase in average duration of forced outages and etc. Comparing frequency and duration of forced
outages can help determine which energy provider tends to be unreliable. 

- Percent of forced outage in 2016 and 2017
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as Total_Number_Forced_Outage_Events, Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events, 
    CAST((CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS DECIMAL(18,2))/CAST(Count(*) AS DECIMAL(18,2)))*100 AS DECIMAL(18,2)) as Forced_Outage_Percentage, 
    Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status = 'Approved'
GROUP BY Year(Start_Time)

- Average duration and average energy lost
SELECT Status, Year(Start_Time) AS Year, ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss, 
    Cast(ROUND(AVG(Cast(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time) AS DECIMAL(18,2))),2) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' 
	And Reason='Forced'
GROUP BY Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time);

- Average duration of each individual outage event
SELECT Status, Reason, Year(Start_Time) AS Year, ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
    Cast(ROUND(AVG(Cast(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time) AS DECIMAL(18,2))),2) AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' 
GROUP BY Status, Reason, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time), Reason;

- Which energy providers tend to be the most unreliable
SELECT Participant_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time) AS Year, ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss, 
    ROUND(AVG(ROUND((TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/60)/24,2)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' 
	AND Reason='Forced'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Status, Reason, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time) ASC, ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) DESC;

- Which energy providers (facility code) tend to be the most unreliable
SELECT Participant_Code, Facility_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time) AS Year, ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) AS Avg_Outage_MW_Loss, 
    ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) AS Summed_Energy_Lost
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved' 
	AND Reason='Forced'
GROUP BY Participant_Code, Facility_Code, Status, Year(Start_Time)
ORDER BY Year(Start_Time) ASC, ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) DESC;
