#Case Study: The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the US domestic energy network. Recently, the AEMR management team has been
noticing large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017. We will explore and clean the data to examine two main areas of concer: 1. energy
stability and Market Outages and 2. energy losses and market reliability. 

#started by examining most common outage types, duartion and frequency
