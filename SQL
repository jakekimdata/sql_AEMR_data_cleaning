#Case Study: The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the US domestic energy network. Recently, the AEMR management team has been
noticing large number of energy providers that submitted outages over the 2016 and 2017. We will explore and clean the data to examine two main areas of concer: 1. energy
stability and Market Outages and 2. energy losses and market reliability. 

#started by examining most common outage types, duartion and frequency

SELECT COUNT(Status) AS Total_Number_Outages, Status, Outage_Reason, Year
FROM AEMR_Outage_Table
Where Status = 'Approved'
AND YEAR = 2016
Group BY Outage_Reason
Order BY Outage_Reason;

-monthly trends to see if there are any issues in particular months over other months
SELECT Year, Month, COUNT(Status) AS Total_Number_Outages
FROM AEMR_Outage_Table
Where Status = 'Approved'
AND YEAR IN (2016, 2017)
Group BY Year, Month
Order BY Year, Month;

-monthly trends showed rapidly increasing from 2016 to 2017. lets examine frequency and duration

FROM AEMR_Outage_Table
WHERE Status = 'Approved'
